## About the application

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Spatie | [Laravel Permission, Associate users with roles and permissions](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission).
- Filament version 3 [Admin Panel](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/installation).
- Filament Shield plugin [The easiest and most intuitive way to add access management to your Filament Admin](https://github.com/bezhanSalleh/filament-shield).
- [Laravel Ownership](https://github.com/cybercog/laravel-ownership) by Anton Komarev.
- BeyondCode | [Add comments to Laravel application](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-comments). 

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
